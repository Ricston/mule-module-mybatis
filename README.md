WELCOME
=======
This is the Mule module for MyBatis developed by Ricston Ltd (www.ricston.com).

To compile and package from source, just execute: mvn package. This will also generate the Mule Studio plugin.

MyBatis is a first class persistence framework with support for custom SQL, stored procedures and advanced mappings. MyBatis eliminates almost all of the JDBC code and manual setting of parameters and retrieval of results. MyBatis can use simple XML or Annotations for configuration and map primitives, Map interfaces and Java POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) to database records.

This connector allows you to use MyBatis from within Mule.

# Mule supported versions

# Installation 
For beta connectors you can download the source code and build it with devkit to find it available on your local repository. Then you can add it to Studio…<TBD>
